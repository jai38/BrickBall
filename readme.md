# Introduction to game
This game includes 1 paddle which can only move horizontally. One ball which will move in any direction.
3 boundaries at top, left and right where ball bounces back after hitting it. Also when ball hits the brick, ball bounces back and brick is destoried and a _**Sound**_ is produced. Background music is also there for making game more entertaining.

# How to play
Move the paddle with right and left arrow keys, set the direction of ball with **A** & **D** once done, press enter to start the game.
If you miss to catch the ball with paddle, you ~~loose~~ get three chances to continue, displayed at top right with **3 red dots as _lifes_**. Once all the lifes are over, then **Game over**

# Additional Information
Game has infinite number of levels, on each brick 5 score is added, as the level increases number of bricks increases so that it gets harder and harder to complete it.
In the right bar, score and level number is displayed with number of remaining lifes.

# Information for developer
